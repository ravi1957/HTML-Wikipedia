        <p>A web browser is application software for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a
            particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the
            user's screen. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and
            smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people used a browser.<sup>[1]</sup> The most used browser is
            Google
            Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%.<sup>[2]</sup>

            A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often
            confused.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup> A search
            engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and
            display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.<sup>[5]</sup> In some technical contexts,
            browsers are
            referred to as user agents. </p>

        <h1>Function</h1>

        <p>
            The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> or from local storage and display
            it on a user's device.[6] This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as
            https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser. Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer
            Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data. If the URL uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS),
            the connection between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of communications
            security and information privacy.[7]

            Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is
            clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Most browsers use an internal cache of web
            page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many
            items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again.[8] Cached items are
            usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.[9]
