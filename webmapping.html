        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>Web mapping or an online mapping is the process of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map" target="_blank">maps</a>, usually created through geographic information
            systems (GIS), on the Internet, more specifically in the World Wide Web (WWW). A web map or an online map is
            both served and consumed, thus web mapping is more than just web cartography, it is a service by which
            consumers may choose what the map will show.<sup>[1]</sup> Web GIS emphasizes geodata processing aspects more involved
            with design aspects such as data acquisition and server software architecture such as data storage and
            algorithms, than it does the end-user reports themselves.<sup>[2]</sup>

            The terms web GIS and web mapping remain somewhat synonymous. Web GIS uses web maps, and end users who are
            web mapping are gaining analytical capabilities. The term location-based services refers to web mapping
            consumer goods and services.<sup>[3]</sup> Web mapping usually involves a <a href="webbrowser.html" target="_blank">web browser</a> or other user agent capable of
            client-server interactions.<sup>[4]</sup> Questions of quality, usability, social benefits, and legal constraints are
            driving its evolution.<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup>

            The advent of web mapping can be regarded as a major new trend in cartography. Until recently cartography
            was restricted to a few companies, institutes and mapping agencies, requiring relatively expensive and
            complex hardware and software as well as skilled cartographers and geomatics engineers.

            Web mapping has brought many geographical datasets, including free ones generated by OpenStreetMap and
            proprietary datasets owned by HERE, Huawei, Google, Tencent, TomTom, and others. A range of free software to
            generate maps has also been conceived and implemented alongside proprietary tools like ArcGIS. As a result,
            the barrier to entry for serving maps on the web has been lowered.</p>
